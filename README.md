The dataset contains the results from a questionnaire of a "The Great American Coffee Taste Test" taken in US. This dataset contains 111 columns and lots of missing values that needed to be taken care for a authentic analysis. Hence using Excel, I made 9 tables from a single dataset:

1) Demographics
2) Spending pattern
3) Blind coffee test results
4) Brewing methods
5) Consuming place info
6) Add-ons info
7) Dairy as add-on info
8) Sugar as add-on info
9) Additional info


Following are some brief insights from the analysis:

Slide 1: Target Audience

Identified key demographics: Age 25-44, educated, male, no children, Democrat.
Preferences: Medium-strong coffee, pour-over method, fruity/chocolaty flavors.
Strategy: Tailor marketing and offerings to meet these preferences.

Slide 2: Product Offering

Offer medium and somewhat strong roasts, reflecting 85% preference.
Feature pour-over and latte prominently, matching 46% favorite drinks.
Include options for whole milk and granulated sugar, preferred additives.

Slide 3: Pricing Strategy

With 60% spending $6-8 on coffee, target pricing primarily at this range. Offer occasional high-priced options for the 19% willing to pay $10-15 and 16% willing to spend over $20. Additionally, consider providing complimentary coffee sachets, leveraging the 38% who spend $100-500 on coffee equipment.
